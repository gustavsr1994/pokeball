# pokeball

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Note: Kasih API sama screenshot disesuaikan. Di screenshot minta species tapi di API ga ada. Di screenshot request height dan weight ada 2 satuan tapi di API cuman 1 satuannya. Dan data2 lain yang bikin waktu kebuang banyak buat nyariin satu2.
